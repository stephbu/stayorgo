# stayorgo
Transit app written in C# for iOS using OneBusAway as data source

## Overview
I get the bus everyday to/from Downtown Seattle.  Commuting can sometimes suck, the buses are quite full, but at least I have 
choices because there are several routes I can take, and the buses are very regular.  When a full bus arrives,
it is often better to wait at the stop for the next bus, because you know 
  a) it will not be far behind b) that it will be less full
  b) you can get a seat

StayOrGo won't solve overcrowding on the buses, but was conceived as a way to figure out just how far away is the 
next bus on my favourite routes.  The project written in the new Visual Studio for Mac using Xamarin Native integration

## OneBusAway
The project uses OneBusAway data provider for Seattle as source for transit data.
